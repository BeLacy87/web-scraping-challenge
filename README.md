This project utilizes PyMongo and BeautifulSoup to scrape the following websites for information on the planet Mars:
-https://mars.nasa.gov/news/ /br
-https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars
-https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en
-https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars

In order to perform the webscrape, the file 'app.js' needs to be running.  This will bring up the index.html on your local server.  The scraping process generally takes between 60-120 seconds.

skills demonstrated: python, pyMongo, BeautifulSoup, HTML, CSS
